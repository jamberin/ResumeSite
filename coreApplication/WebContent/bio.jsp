		It all started when I was first introduced to computers. It was in my uncle Jim's office, he had an older model Macintosh, I think it was a Power Macintosh.  I remember browsing the internet, just clicking on links, not really paying attention what I was doing or where I was going.  Just the changing of the pages magically going from one to the next. Over time that mysteriousness wore off and I became much more acclimated with computers. 
		</br></br>
		I was fortunate enough to go to an elementary school that had a classroom full of computers.  At least three times a week in my eight years leading up to high school I had exposure to technology.  All that time, I never lost interest, even as the intrigue became comprehension. Leading into high school I tried to keep my focus on computers.  Classes that gave exposure to computers, I was trying to take. This lead to me aiming my college goals toward computer engineering.
		</br></br>
		I was able to get into the engineering program at the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford after graduating from high school in 2010. After two and a half years into the program, I re-evaluated where I wanted my career to go and adjusted my major to Computer Information Systems & Technology (CIS&T). I later got my degree in 2015, immediately being placed at the help desk with WESCO Distribution's eCommerce team. After working as a Help Desk Analyst for two years, I applied for a Quality Assurance Analyst within the same team.  
		</br></br>
		I strive to continue gaining experience in different disciplines and learning as much as possible.
